#A demo of how to create workspaces in PowerBI using PowerShell, upload a report to the workspace, set its parameters and trigger a refresh. Then, add the users with the correct access rights to the workspaces.
#And a little bit of Starwars quotes, because why not?
#Prerequisites: PowerBI module installed, PowerBI account, workspaces.txt file with the names of the workspaces to be created
#Install the PowerBI module, if not already installed
if (!(Get-Module -Name MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt -ListAvailable)) {
    Install-Module -Name MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt
}   
else {
    Write-Host "PowerBI module already installed"
} 

#Let's get cracking!
#Connect to the PowerBI service
#Login to PowerBI
Login-PowerBI


#Get a list of all the workspaces
Get-PowerBIWorkspace
$workspaces = Get-PowerBIWorkspace
$workspaces
$workspaces[-1]


#Make a workspace with the name of the company
$tempcompany = "Demo"
New-PowerBIWorkspace -Name $tempcompany
#Verify that the workspace was created
Get-PowerBIWorkspace -name $tempcompany
#Put that in a variable
$checkworkspace=Get-PowerBIWorkspace -name $tempcompany
#Check the name and id of the workspace
$checkworkspace.name
$checkworkspace.id
#Notice the workspace id, it's the same as in Power BI Service

#Great, but what if you want to check if the workspace already exists before creating it?
#You can use the if statement and the Get-PowerBIWorkspace commandto check if the workspace already exists
#If the workspace already exists, the workspace will not be created
#If the workspace doesn't exist, the workspace will be created
if (!(Get-PowerBIWorkspace -name $tempcompany)) {
    New-PowerBIWorkspace -Name $tempcompany
}
else {
    Write-Host "Workspace already exists"
}


#Fair enough, but what if you want to create a lot of workspaces?
#Yoda: "Do. Or do not. There is no try."
#You can use a text file with the names of the workspaces to be created
#and then loop through the text file to create the workspaces

#Creating workspaces with the names from workspaces.txt, if they don't already exist
$CompanyNames = Get-Content -Path "workspaces.txt"

#What's a loop?
#A loop is a way to repeat a set of commands multiple times
#In this case, we want to loop through the list of company names and create a workspace for each company
#The loop will stop when it reaches the end of the list of company names
#Example: If the list of company names is "Company1", "Company2", "Company3", the loop will create a workspace for each company
#and then stop
#A foreach loop is used to loop through a list of items
foreach ($company in $CompanyNames) {
        New-PowerBIWorkspace -Name $company
  }

#Great, but what if you want to check if the workspace already exists before creating it?
#Darth Vader: "I find your lack of faith disturbing."
#Let's put it all together and create a loop that checks if the workspace already exists before creating it with if-clause and foreach-loop
#You can use the Get-PowerBIWorkspace command to check if the workspace already exists
#If the workspace already exists, the command will return the name of the workspace
#If the workspace doesn't exist, the command will return nothing
#You can use the if statement to check if the workspace already exists
#If the workspace already exists, the if statement will return true
#If the workspace doesn't exist, the if statement will return false
#If the workspace doesn't exist, the New-PowerBIWorkspace command will be executed
#If the workspace already exists, the New-PowerBIWorkspace command will not be executed
#Example: If the list of company names is "Company1", "Company2", "Company3", the loop will check if the workspace "Company1" exists
#If the workspace "Company1" doesn't exist, the New-PowerBIWorkspace command will be executed and a workspace with the name "Company1" will be created
#If the workspace "Company1" already exists, the New-PowerBIWorkspace command will not be executed and a workspace with the name "Company1" will not be created
#A foreach loop is used to loop through a list of items         
foreach ($company in $CompanyNames) {
  $checkworkspace=Get-PowerBIWorkspace -name $company
    if( $company -ine $checkworkspace.Name) {
      New-PowerBIWorkspace -Name $company
    } 
    else {write-host "Workspace "$checkworkspace.name" already exists, will not create."}   
}

#Check that the workspaces were created
#Pipe the results of the Get-PowerBIWorkspace command to the where-object command
#What's a pipe again?
#A pipe is used to pass the results of one command to another command
#The where-object command will filter the results of the Get-PowerBIWorkspace command
#The where-object command will only return the workspaces that have a name that is in the list of company names
#The list of company names is stored in the $CompanyNames variable
$workspaces = Get-PowerBIWorkspace| where-object {$CompanyNames -contains $_.name} 
#The $_.name is used to refer to the name of the workspace that is returned by the Get-PowerBIWorkspace command
